			<h1 class="intro__hed">WHO: Disabilities</h1>
			<p class="intro__dek">
				Disability is the result from an individual with a health condition and societal barriers that limit their ability to perform day-to-day tasks and participate fully in society.
			</p>
      <p class="intro__dek">
				Currently, about 16% of the global population are living with a significant disability. Around 70% of them are invisible and almost everyone will face a disability even if temporary once in their lives.

				<div class="step" data-step="1">
					<p>The percentage of people with significant disabilities due to different health conditions varies across the world regions, country income, individuals gender and other dimensions.</p>
          <p><span class="highlight-black">Europe</span> and <span class="highlight-black">Americas</span> are the regions with the highest percentage of people experiencing significant disabilities, while <span class="highlight-black">Africa</span> has the lowest percentage.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="2">
					<p>When exclusively focusing on the severe disabilities prevalence, <span class="highlight-black">Americas</span> becomes the first region in terms of affected people percentage and <span class="highlight-black">Africa's</span> last position remains unchanged.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="3">
					<p>There is an extensive list of health conditions that may cause moderate and/or severe disabilities and the severity implied by each of them also varies.</p> 
          <p>For instance, <span class="highlight-cause">Schizophrenia</span> and <span class="highlight-cause">African trypanosomiasis</span> are solely associated with severe disabilities. And <span class="highlight-cause">Low back pain</span>, the main cause of disabilities worldwide, causes no more than moderate disabilities.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="4">
					<p>In contrast, most disabilities implied by <span class="highlight-cause">Chronic kidney disease</span> are severe. For each individual with moderate disabilities due to this condition, there can be other 25 people with severe disabilities caused by the same condition.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="5">
					<p>To come up with a summarized grasp of how these and other health conditions behave in different dimensions, they are grouped together by similar traits.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="6">
					<p><span class="highlight-group">Musculoskeletal disorders</span> imply reduced mobility and dexterity. It's the main group cause of significant disabilities worldwide, specially due to Low back pain.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="7">
					<p><span class="highlight-black">Americas</span> and <span class="highlight-black">Europe</span> are the regions with the greater prevalence of significant disabilities caused by <span class="highlight-black">Musculoskeletal disorders</span>.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="8">
					<p>Americas has also the unfortunate fact of being the region in which the prevalence of people with severe disabilities due to musculoskeletal conditions is 40% greater than the world average.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="9">
					<p>On the other hand, Africa is the only region where the group is not the leading, but the second, contributor to significant disabilities in its population.</p>
				</div>
        <div class="step" data-step="10">
          <p>Mental disorders entail significant disturbances in thinking, emotional regulation, or behavior. It's the second main cause of significant disabilities worldwide, specially due to Major depressive disorder and Anxiety disorders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="11">
          <p>1 in every 3 people with a significant disability due to Major depressive disorder are experiencing severe impairments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="12">
          <p>Again, Americas and Europe are the regions with the greater prevalence of significant disabilities caused by Mental Disorders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="13">
          <p>Mental disorders is the main cause of significant disabilities in Africa.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="14">
          <p>Neurological disorders hit the central and peripheral nervous system and they constitute the third leading cause of significant disabilities. Migraine is the leading cause.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="15">
          <p>The prevalence of significant disabilities caused by Alzheimer's disease and dementias and Parkinson's disease are much greater in Europe, Western Pacific and Americas than in the rest of the world.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="16">
          <p>Africa has the lowest prevalence of all the causes in this group, but at Idiopathic epilepsy, in which it has the highest percentage of afflicted people. This is the only health condition in this group to imply severe disabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="17">
          <p>There are 19 health condition group causes to significant disabilities, but Musculoskeletal, Mental, and Neurological disorders together correspond to about 60% of the causes to significant disabilities worldwide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="18">
          <p>Now, let's have a glance in other interesting observations.</p>
          <p>South-East Asia is the region with the highest percentage of people facing disabilities due to Vision loss disorders and diseases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="19">
          <p>Ischemic stroke (Cardiovascular diseases) carries a high risk of death and the survivors can experience loss of vision and/or speech, paralysis and confusion. Disabilities caused by it has the highest prevalences at Western Pacific and Europe.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="20">
          <p>The turn over here is although Africa has the lowest prevalence of disabilities due to Ischemic stroke, its inhabitants suffers much more severe impairments than the ones in other regions. The proportion of severe disabilities caused by Ischemic stroke in Africa is almost twice as much the second region with the highest proportion of severe disabilities due to this condition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="21">
          <p>WHO alerts Neonatal Preterm Birth is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years. South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean has the highest percentage of people suffering for having been premature babies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="21">
          <p>Western Pacific was the region with the lowest percentage of people with disabilities caused by COVID-19. The prevalence in there was around 92% lower than the world average.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="23">
          <p>African people still carry a large burden of disabilities due to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections and Neglected tropical diseases. The percentage of people with disabilities due to these condition groups in Africa is respectively 12x and 3.1x higher than the prevalence in Americas, the region with the second higher percentage of affected people by those groups.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="24">
          <p>Europe and Americas are the regions with the highest prevalence of severe disabilities due to Skin and subcutaneous diseases, while Africa is where people are the least affected by disabilities from this reason.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="25">
          <p>Americas has the leading percentage of people with moderate or severe disabilities due to Substance use disorders. The prevalence in this region is around 80% higher than the global average and the main reason is Opioids, a broad group of pain-relieving drugs that include heroin and morphine.</p>
